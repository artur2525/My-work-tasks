###:metal: Easy:
<ul>docstring - auto docstringing
<li>make_file - docker file
<li>valid_emails - speed up regular expressions
<li>gr boost - writing GRADIENT BOOSTING
<li>rotate image - bug search
<li>dec tree - writing descision tree
<li>yaml_config - recursion training
<li>t_test - calculate A/b t-test
<li>mwc - We are writing a service to process a large number of articles published on our platform. 
In order to engage in thematic modeling, you need to calculate the occurrence of words.
<li>recall@k - metrics for recomendation systems 
<li>NEGATIVE TESTS - Exception Handling
<li>memorezatio -  cashing with decorators
<li>py_test - pytest
<li>top10 - calculate top10 in sql query
<li>dau - calculate dau, wau metrics in clickhouse
<li>ASYMMETRIC METRICS - calculate metrics
<li>Stocks - preprocessing dynamic pricing model
<li>Cold start - Forecasting for new products is a very important thing that will help new users to see relevant products in recommendations more often or businesses to predict user behavior. You decided to add the fillna_with_mean function, which fills in the gaps in the target column with its average values by groups. Grouping occurs by the group column.
<li>negative tests with text - automete text denial 
<li>SMAPE - There are many metrics for regression tasks. For example, for forecasting tasks, in addition to the well-known RMSE, MAE and MAE, MAPE, WAPE, sMAPE and others are used.
<li>Count_SKU - SKU stands for stock keeping unit, and translates as a warehouse accounting unit. Almost every product has its own unique number by which you can track some of its statistics.
</ul> 
###:metal: Medium:
<ul>abstract_selector - convert class to @abstractmethod
<li>ARPPU - calculate metrics 
<li>competitor price -We are engaged in dynamic pricing and we want our model to take into account the prices of competitors. Let's assume that for each product (sku) we have a base_price – our current price. For each of our products, thanks to the matching team, 1, several or none of the competitors' prices were found – they are recorded in the comp_price column. Competitors have priority (rank column), and there may be gaps in the ranks (or -1 if no competitor's price is found).
<li>Gain - rewriting class with decorator
<li>multiproc - Multiprocessing
<li>pd - payment dashboard
<li>pyspark - DQ REPORT
<li>tree_sql - convert DECISION TREE to sql query and json file
<li>matching - A list of tuple is expected at the input and output. The output list should be sorted, not contain duplicates, and in each pair the product with a lower index is in the first place.
Example of input data:
[(1, 2), (7, 2)]
<li>nDCG - range weighted metrics 
<li>similarity item price - similarity embedings
<li>smart_link1 - EPSILON-GREEDY
<li>wau - Write a request with the calculation of WAU for the entire period in a sliding window per week in increments of 1 day, while the current date should be included in the calculation.
<li>smart_link2 - A/B DESIGN
<li>Elasticity Feature - calculate Elasticity
<ul>
###:metal: Medium:
<ul>Bootstrap - calculat confidence interval of ml model metric woth bootstraping
<ul>SKu - calculate embedings with tf_idf
